BrainStim Project Analysis Tools:
(code author: Fahimeh Baftizadeh)

Essentially, all the experimental data is gathered into a big table, then we use that big table for analysis.

A. Two files necessary for analysis: 

	1. The experimental data .nwb files live in: //allen/aibs/mat/sooyl/50KHz_nwb_files
		Example: //allen/aibs/mat/sooyl/50KHz_nwb_files/2018_07_25_113957_50_compressed.nwb

	2. .json files associated with each .nwb file live in: //allen/aibs/mat/sooyl/Stimulus_Item_Values/
		Example: //allen/aibs/mat/sooyl/Stimulus_Item_Values/2018_07_25_113957_50.json
			These .json files have information about the corresponding experiment which are critical for building the table.

B. Analysis codes:
	
	1. You will need:
		a. http://fahimehb@stash.corp.alleninstitute.org/scm/mind/brain_stim.git
		b. b. https://github.com/alleninstitute/aisynphys.git
			**Note: multipatch_analysis (https://github.com/aiephys/multipatch_analysis.git) is the old package name and repo. On 9/30/2019, it was changed to aisynphys.			
		c. https://github.com/aiephys/neuroanalysis.git
	brain_stim is for running the analysis codes. Luke Campagnola's aisynphys & neuroanalysis tools are for parsing through the .nwb files.

	1b. jupyter notebooks:
		a. //allen/aibs/mat/sooyl/notebook_Fahimeh/Build_and_check_table_original.ipynb
		b. //allen/aibs/mat/sooyl/notebook_Fahimeh/Analysis_of_PC_and_PV_original.ipynb

	2.	So first, we use Build_and_check_table_original.ipynb to build a table.
		The output will be a table in .h5 file format for each .nwb file. Each table will be placed in //allen/aibs/mat/sooyl/result_tables.
		Currently, the code depends on the .nwb and .json files living in their designated folder.
			e.g. The code looks for .nwb files in //allen/aibs/mat/sooyl/50KHz_nwb_files.
		You'd need to change the filepath locations in the brain_stim package if you want to change filepath locations (of .nwb, .json, maybe .h5, files).

	3.	Then we can run Analysis_of_PC_and_PV.ipynb for the actual analysis.
			This code takes in experiment id's (e.g. "2018_07_25_113957", if the .h5 file lives in //allen/aibs/mat/sooyl/result_tables) or full filepaths (//allen/aibs/mat/sooyl/result_tables/table_2018_07_25_113957_50.h5)
